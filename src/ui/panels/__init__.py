# src/ui/panels/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'panels' directory a Python package.

# Optionally, you can import panel classes here for easier access,
# though it's often cleaner to import them directly where needed.
# Example:
# from .console_panel import ConsolePanel
# from .dashboard_panel import DashboardPanel
# ... etc.
