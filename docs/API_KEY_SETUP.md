# 🔑 API Key Setup Guide

This guide will help you get API keys for Stream Artifact's optional features. **Remember: all of these are completely optional!**

## 🤖 OpenRouter (AI Features)

### What is it?
OpenRouter gives you access to multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.) through one API.

### Cost & Rate Limits?
- **Free tier:** Available! Perfect for testing
  - 50 requests/day if you have less than $10 credit
  - **1,000 requests/day if you have $10+ credit** (20x more!)
- **Paid usage:** Optional - premium models cost extra

### 💡 Why $10 Matters:
Having at least $10 in your OpenRouter account gives you **20x more daily requests** (1,000 vs 50), even when using free models! Stream Artifact protects you by defaulting to free models only, so your $10 stays safe.

### How to get it:
1. Go to [OpenRouter API Keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Sign up for a free account if needed
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-or-`)
5. Optional: Add $10+ credit for higher daily limits

### 🛡️ Stream Artifact Protection:
- **Defaults to FREE models only** - your credits are safe!
- You must explicitly enable premium models (with warnings)
- Keeps you above the $10 threshold for better daily limits
